My journey in digital modeling, which began with my master's thesis, has now led me to a **tenure track as a professor at KU Leuven**. This role marks a significant milestone in my career, which has been dedicated to the exploration and development of digital construction models. My work has spanned from city-scale GIS models to individual building scale models using BIM/FEM. I've contributed to diverse projects, including those in Cuenca, Ecuador, Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, and the Colosseum in Rome.

During my Ph.D. at KU Leuven, I honed my focus on optimizing design procedures for these models, deepening my **expertise in computational geometries and machine learning**. A pivotal realization was the inherent abstraction in design models leading to underperformance in practical construction applications. To tackle this, I obtained a personal FWO postdoc scholarship for independent research.

My postdoctoral journey included significant contributions to the H2020 V4Design project, where I successfully integrated **Linked Data management with construction data, resulting in the GEOMAPI API**. This work was recognized and published in a high-ranking journal. Collaborations with esteemed European research groups such as TU Delft, Utwente, FBK, and INSA enriched my experience, leading to joint publications and an enhancement of both my technical and soft skills.

A breakthrough during my time at FBK revealed how combining imagery and point cloud data could address key deficiencies in Neural Networks. Returning to KU Leuven, **I led five industry projects and guided Ph.D. students** in expanding the GEOMAPI API, while our research into implicit construction representations from close-range observations is currently under submission.

Now, in my tenure track position at KU Leuven and with nearly a decade of combined academic and industry experience, I am **well-equipped to spearhead this ERC grant proposal**. The goal is to surmount the principal limitations of digital modeling. Given the fundamental nature of this research and its non-commercial focus, pursuing it within an academic framework is most suitable. My unique skill set, insights, team, and network make this ambitious project both feasible and highly relevant to the field.
